 Building a test suite using WebDriver will require you to understand and effectively use a number of different components. As with everything in software, different people use different terms for the same idea. Below is a breakdown of how terms are used in this description.

 Through WebDriver, Selenium supports all major browsers on the market such as Chrom(ium), Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari. Where possible, WebDriver drives the browser using the browser&amp;rsquo;s built-in support for automation, although not all browsers have official support for remote control.
WebDriver&amp;rsquo;s aim is to emulate a real user&amp;rsquo;s interaction with the browser as closely as possible.</description>

 Ruby Ruby is not installed by default on Windows. Download the latest version and run the installer. You can leave all settings at default values, except at the Installation Destination and Optional Tasks screen check Add Ruby executables to your PATH checkbox. To drive any browser, you have to install selenium-webdriver Ruby gem.</description>

 WebDriver can generally be said to have a blocking API. Because it is an out-of-process library that instructs the browser what to do, and because the web platform has an intrinsically asynchronous nature, WebDriver doesn&amp;rsquo;t track the active, real-time state of the DOM. This comes with some challenges that we will discuss here.</description>

 WebDriver support classes are provided to simplify maintaining your code. They provide a nice abstraction to make modeling HTML element(s) as domain objects easier, also providing helper methods to make using such objects easy to reason about. We will learn about:
 Locator Strategies Events LoadableComponent ThreadGuard etc.</description>

 WebDriver provides an API for working with the three types of native popup message offered by JavaScript. These popups are styled by the browser and offer limited customisation.
Alerts The simplest of these is referred to as an alert, which shows a custom message, and a single button which dismisses the alert, labelled in most browsers as OK.</description>

 A proxy server acts as an intermediary for requests between a client and a server. In simple, the traffic flows through the proxy server on its way to the address you requested and back.
A proxy server for automation scripts with Selenium could be helpful for:
 Capture network traffic Mock backend calls made by the website Access the required website under complex network topologies or strict corporate restrictions/policies.</description>

 Defines the current session&amp;rsquo;s page loading strategy. By default, when Selenium WebDriver loads a page, it follows the normal pageLoadStrategy. It is always recommended to stop downloading additional resources (like images, css, js) when the page loading takes lot of time.
The document.readyState property of a document describes the loading state of the current document.</description>

 WebElement represents a DOM element. WebElements can be found by searching from the document root using a WebDriver instance, or by searching under another WebElement.
WebDriver API provides built-in methods to find the WebElements which are based on different properties like ID, Name, Class, XPath, CSS Selectors, link Text, etc.</description>

 Keyboard represents a KeyBoard event. KeyBoard actions are performed by using low-level interface which allows us to provide virtualized device input to the web browser.
sendKeys The sendKeys types a key sequence in DOM element even if modifier key sequence is encountered. Here are the list of possible keystrokes that WebDriver Supports.</description>
