 Selenium controls web browsers Selenium is many things but at its core, it is a toolset for web browser automation that uses the best techniques available to remotely control browser instances and emulate a user&amp;rsquo;s interaction with the browser.
It allows users to simulate common activities performed by end-users; entering text into fields, selecting drop-down values and checking boxes, and clicking links in documents.</description>

 Acceptance testing This type of testing is done to determine if a feature or system meets the customer expectations and requirements. This type of testing generally involves the customer&amp;rsquo;s cooperation or feedback, being a validation activity that answers the question:

 These docs, like the code itself, are maintained 100% by volunteers within the Selenium community. Many have been using it since its inception, but many more have only been using it for a short while, and have given their time to help improve the onboarding experience for new users.</description>
